            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>A group project divided into two parts. one design and user testing part, and one implementing part.</p>
              
            <p>The main goal was to create a page for Noroff (the school im studying at) that showed all major events of the year, example: school start, student council election etc.</p>
            <p>
                This meant we also had to user test on the diffrent target audience.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="grid">
            <h2>The requirements</h2>
            <p>Requirements was as following:</p>

                <li>user testing to get relevant feedback and see if the product works as intended.</li>
                <li>
                    store and access the relevant data on an api.
                </li>

            <h2>The final version</h2>
            <p> The final product is a very simple and easy web page to use, there is not to many choices. the filtering of diffrent data is very fast, and it allows for secondary filters after the main filteris chosen.

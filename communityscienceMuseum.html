            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>In this Project i was tasked with creating a website for a fictional local museum.
                The project needed to have multiple pages, for the diffrent information about the museum.</p>
                <p class="listInfo">Some of the pages</p>
            <ul>
                <li>events</li>
                <li>exhibits</li>
                <li>visit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the project I also had to make an entire plan from scratch, where i divided the avalible weeks of the project into the diffrent steps of the project.</p>

            <h2>The final version</h2>
            <p> Here is the final version and its features. a website that works over multiple screen sizes, optimized for quick loading and follows WCAG guide lines.</p>

                <div class="grid">
                <h3>How it looks</h3>
                <p>Here is some screenshots you can look at of how the 
                    page looks on diffrent screen sizes, as well as get a feeling of how it is.</p>

                <div class="grid product mobile">
                    <h4>Mobile devides</h4>
                    <p>On Mobile Devices, i took full advantage of the width of diffrent sizes, so it is more easy to look at images.</p>

                    <h4>tablet and medium sized devices</h4>
                    <p>
                        On tablet devices, the height and width are being used to show a bit more content at once. While keeping key features the same, for example buttons, so there is no new learning curve for diffrent sizes.

                    <h4>Laptop and desktop</h4>
                    <p>With more space, things like navigation bar is shown at all times and  there is room for more content.</p>
